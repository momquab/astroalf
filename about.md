# About Astronomer Alfie

Hi, I’m astronomer Alfie! 

I am absolutely and completely obsessed with SPACE and the Solar System!

When I was two years old, I knew all the planets and their positions from the sun. Now I’m learning about supernovas and black holes! The universe is huge and there’s so much to learn.

I enjoy travelling to places that have Solar System trails, baking space-themed tasty treats, reading, and Nintendo games. I am always crafting and love to share my ideas with you all - so enjoy my website and be sure to keep coming back for more updates!
