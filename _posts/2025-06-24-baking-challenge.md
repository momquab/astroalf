Every month I do a baking challenge. It normally has something to do with my favourite things: Space or the Human Body. This year I’ve made Solar System cupcakes and cookies, Kirby cupcakes and human body biscuits (red/ white blood cells and poo ones). Check out these photos - aren’t they cool? And they’re so delicious! July’s challenge is Meteor Bites and I cannot wait…
