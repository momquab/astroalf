Konnichiwa! We travel a lot to Japan as my parentâ€™s used to live there and they work there twice a year. So every day I practice some Japanese so I can talk to my Japanese friends. I love Japan as there are so many fun arcades to play on and the food is so tasty. 

There are also lots of Space related things to do. On our last trip my daddy took me to JAXA - the Japanese Space Agency. We got to see massive rockets and even went into their mission control - it was so exciting. 

We also did a Solar System Trail at the National Astronomical Observatory. Itâ€™s a small straight road that shows you the size of the planets in their order from the sun and also the size of them. I was super lucky as a friend of mine brought me super special space themed chocolates which I ate along the way - itâ€™s the second time Iâ€™ve been and I canâ€™t wait to go again soon ðŸ™‚
